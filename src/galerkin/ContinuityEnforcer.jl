    let L be the Laplacian associated to Q, and N = 1/h be the number of steps
    given a ρ ∈ V_{n,h}^1, m ∈ V_{e,h}^0, we want to project onto the set of
    (ρ, m) satisfying the Galerkin-discretized discrete continuity equation (see eqn (10)
    in Erbar et al. 2020). A Lagrange mulitpliers argument shows that this can be done by solving
    a linear system Ax=b, where A is, essentially, the "differential operator"
    D = (∂t^2) + L
    Now because the the value of Lf(x) will in general depend on non-local information
    (i.e values of f away from x), care must be taken when setting up this projection problem,
    and we must treat it as one simultaneous linear system on R^{NV + 1 × NV + 1}
